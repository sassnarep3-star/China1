# Coordination

Session: arena-3e9a7b87 (sole active session observed). All work remains on the Arena-required branch `arena/3e9a7b87-china1`; this overrides the requested alternate branch naming.

## Log
- 2026-11-07: Initial repository contains only README.md, with no existing analysis, source data, site, or competing claims. Claimed integrated scope before implementation. No user-specific tax/account facts supplied; these must remain unknown rather than inferred.
- Initial claim push: remote session branch did not yet exist, so `pull --rebase origin <session-branch>` failed. Rebased against origin/main instead, then published the required session branch. No conflicts and no other work discarded.
- Research inspected 2026-11-07: PBOC Decree [2006] No.3 Articles 3, 7, 9, 13–15; HSBC China Individual FX Services Guide (purchase/property/outbound sections); Wise CNY guide (outbound eligibility and limits); IRS worldwide-income, FX translation, foreign tax credit and FBAR/8938 guidance; GPO 2024 section 988; China Customs passenger guide. Direct links and inspection scopes are in docs/sources.html and docs/data.json.
- Evidence irregularities are published in docs/review.html: quota wording/classification, missing personal facts/quotes, source age, incompletely retrieved Shenzhen filing page (official search excerpt only), unverified alternative services/crypto/cash permit rules. No numerical personal fees, taxes, or exchange rates invented.
- Local verification: `python scripts/build.py` and `python scripts/verify.py` passed; 6 pages and 60 table rows, each with official-source reference; relative links and source domains validated; unknown cost values blank. External source retrieval is recorded, not claimed as continuous live-link uptime verification.
